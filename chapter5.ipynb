    "There are two strategies used to avoid rank sinks. First, when a node is reached that has no outgoing relationships, PageRank assumes outgoing relationships to all nodes. Traversing these invisible links is sometimes called teleportation. Second, the damping factor provides another opportunity to avoid sinks by introducing a probability for direct link versus random node visitation. When you set d to 0.85, a completely random node is visited 15% of the time.\n",

    "Although the original formula recommends a damping factor of 0.85, its initial use was on the World Wide Web with a power-law distribution of links (most pages have very few links and a few pages have many). Lowering the damping factor decreases the likelihood of following long relationship paths before taking a random jump. In turn, this increases the contribution of a node s immediate predecessors to its score and rank.\n",
