Hi. I don't understand the module part.

#(a) What is 307,385? All modules in the entire GREG? Or all modules in chr12? How can be almost as many modules as nodes? 
You are right. There have a lot of modules just have one nodes. Because in the first arguments, I didn't use distinct to ask only unique nodes. it made a lot of duplicated nodes. 

All modules just made by those nodes which are related chr12 nodes (included chr12 nodes, but only limit those chr12 nodes have relationships.

I improved that by add distinct factions for the first arguments about louvain.

The results will become 34 communites.


#(b) All modules I see are made of bins. Where are the TFs? 

 At module_chr12_total object, I only returned all nodes are chr12, not included TF. So you only saw bins and not TFs.





#(c) What are the 50 modules in module_chr12_total? I thought it was the 50 largest, but no, many have one only node. 



#(d) In the plot where you show modules with allnode, chr12node and gene (module_chr12_list), how can you have allnode and chr12node in the same module? Modules using all nodes can't be the same as modules using only chr12. 



#(e) In the enrichment part, you just show me a list of GO or KEGG terms. I need to see the GO or KEGG terms for each module.


#Problem to fix 1: I checked module_chr12_total. There are ZERO TF, no module includes TFs. Where are the TFs?


#
Problem to fix 2: I checked "queryLouvainForChr12_TargetNodesInModules". I am not sure what is Louvain doing when you ask "where id(n) in #{TargetNodes_NodeID}", but I think that it might be excluding all other nodes from the community generation process. 

Please use Louvain for ALL nodes and get ALL communities, do not filter anything inside Neo4j, and please report the information of ALL the nodes inside ALL communities. 

Then, send all community information in a table or dataframe to R. After all communities are in R, filter the small communities and select the target nodes IN R, not inside the Louvain query. I suspect results may be different.
